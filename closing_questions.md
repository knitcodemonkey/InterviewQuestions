# Closing Questions

* What are your concerns about joining The Company? 
    * What situations sound like they arenâ€™t a good fit, and why?
    * If they nail the issue spot on, then admit it. Better to cut a candidate loose now, than to hire them, onboard them, and lose them shortly after.
    * If they got the wrong impression, correct it. 
* What would make you decide to join us anyway?
    * What makes up for those deficits? 
    * What do you like about The Company?

# Great questions that would work for any interview in the process

* Do you have any feedback about this interview or the hiring process? How could we have made the experience better?
* If you could go back and change an answer to a question, what would you like to say instead?
* What question do you wish we had asked?
* What is the most interesting/best interview question you've ever heard?
* What is the scariest interview question?
* If we could learn just one thing about you, what would you like it to be?
