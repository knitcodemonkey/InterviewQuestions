# Team Sell Interview

The fine art of airing The Company’s dirty laundry, while also making it clear why we stay.

The scorecard for this interview will likely be a single text box, and a hire yes/no. This focuses on them and their questions.

Signals: All of the other interviews focus on whether the candidate fits The Company, but this interview should focus on whether The Company fits the candidate. We need them, they don’t necessarily need us. Let’s make sure we fit their goals. 

These questions are here as examples if there is a lull in the conversation. They are meant to flesh out the similarities and differences between The Company and what the candidate is looking for in their next role. If we match, talk it up! If we don’t, make sure the candidate knows what situation they would be walking into. Be honest! Tell them about where we are, not just where we want to be.

This is the place where the candidate can truly feel the truth behind “transparency” and “caring for our people.” Though some of these questions may sound unprofessional, that is the point. It Disarms their defensiveness, gets them to relax, and helps them recognize this conversation is real, honest, and gritty. You are the friend that gives them the truth.

If a candidate still chooses The Company knowing what adventures and pitfalls await them, they are signing up to help. They are far more likely to stay with us longer. They are more invested in the growth of The Company, the technology, and their team.
