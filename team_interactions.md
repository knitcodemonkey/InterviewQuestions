# Team Interaction

* How do you coordinate work with remote members of your team?
* Tell me about the most frustrating person you've ever had to work with. 
* What did you like most about someone who mentored you.
* Tell me something you've learned from being a mentor. 
* How would one of your peers/coworkers describe you?
* How would your previous manager describe you using only three words?
